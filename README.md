# OPEN WEATHER MAP

The Open Weather Map Application is a simple React.js web application that enables users to search for weather information by entering the name of a city. It utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data based on the user's input. The interface is user-friendly, allowing users to quickly obtain the current temperature and weather description for the desired city. To get started, users need to obtain a free API key from OpenWeatherMap and replace it in the code.
